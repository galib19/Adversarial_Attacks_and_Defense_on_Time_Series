Final course project: written report + oral presentation 

Written report deadline: 4/22 (Friday, 11:59 pm est); sent to liusiji5@msu.edu

Presentation week: The week of 4/25 

Please see Lecture 20 notes for more information. In what follows, I repeat some details. 

Writing requirements (same as HW1 and HW2) except the following:
▶ Individual submission: 4 pages.
▶ Group submission: 6 − 8 pages.
▶ NeurIPS-template: In group submission, needs a section entitled ’Individual Contributions’ to clearly define tasks/contributions done by each group member.

Other requirements of the final course project:

1) You are free to choose the project topic only if it is correlated to the course content. 

2) We allow either individual project submission or group-wise project submission; see requirements below.
▶ Up to n group members (n ≤ 3) (start to form groups now)
▶ Project contains at least n ‘intellectual merits’ (i.e., contributions)
▶ ‘Intellectual merits’ (contributions) can be justified by problem setup, formulation, methodology, applications, experiment performance etc.
▶ General principle: Only if you see and can justify why a contribution is significant (to some extent), then it is an ‘intellectual merit’.

3) If you are unsure about the course project topic and requirements, please feel free to discuss them with me after classes or via email.
