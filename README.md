# On the Susceptibility and Robustness of Time Series Models through Adversarial Attack and Defense

## Abstract: 
Under adversarial attacks, time series regression and classification are vulnerable.
Adversarial defense, on the other hand, can make the models more resilient. It is
important to evaluate how vulnerable different time series models are to attacks
and how well they recover using defense. The sensitivity to various attacks and
the robustness using the defense of several time series models are investigated in
this study. Experiments are run on seven time series models with three adversarial
attacks and one adversarial defense. According to the findings, all models, particularly GRU and RNN, appear to be vulnerable. LSTM and GRU also have better
defense recovery. FGSM exceeds the competitors in terms of attacks. PGD attacks
are more difficult to recover from than other sorts of attacks.
